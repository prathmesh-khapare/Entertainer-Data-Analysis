Following the amalgamation of the datasets, I've crafted a consolidated file enriched with supplementary information, enabling a more comprehensive analysis and the creation of interactive dashboards. Employing tools such as pandas, MS Excel, and Tableau facilitated this process.

Visual Insights:

* Entertainer Distribution
* Analysis of Most Awards and Nominees
* Exploration of Most Oscars, Grammies, and Emmies recipients
* Other Awards Received by Entertainers
* Noteworthy Entertainers with Mega Awards
* Compilation of the Top 10 Entertainers
* In-depth Individual Analysis
